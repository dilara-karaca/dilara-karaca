## About Me

Hi, I’m **Dilara Karaca**, a Computer Engineering student studying in English.  
I am actively learning and practicing **frontend, backend, and mobile application development**
through academic projects, research-based work, and internships.

I enjoy building user interfaces, developing application logic, and understanding how systems
work end-to-end. I focus on improving myself by working on real-world projects and continuously
learning new technologies.
